              In <i>NKOSO</i>, I invite you into the sacred pages of my cultural
              journal—a poetic odyssey through the soul of my Congolese heritage
              and the intimate corners of my being. Each stroke of design
              whispers tales of my ancestry, and each color palette echoes the
              hues of my identity. Through ink and pixels, I weave a tapestry of
              tradition and personal narrative—a mosaic of ancient rhythms and
              modern musings. Bold typography dances with the spirits of my
              forebears, while vibrant colors sing the songs of my heart. In
              this visual memoir, I lay bare the contours of my truth—the echoes
              of my past, the dreams of my future. NKOSO is not merely a
              project; it's a voyage—a whispered invitation to explore the
              depths of my soul and the richness of my culture, one brushstroke
              at a time.

              For my project,<i>Emotional Mindspaces</i>, I aim for readers to
              navigate a journey through the mindset we have during emotional
              stress or heightened emotion. In my first book, I include images
              and writing that reflect my perspective when grappling with
              depression. It feels as if I am in a dark pit and everything
              around me is gray. In my second book, I talk about my experience
              with anxiety and how it restricts my ability to act freely. Each
              book is printed on cardstock with clear acrylic covers and bound
              with a Coptic stitch. The covers are clear because they symbolize
              my feelings in a glass box. With this project, I strive for
              transparency about my feelings and as much as I want to hide them,
              they are on display for all to see.

              <i>Bringing It Home.</i> It was a lovely coincidence that my
              brother just so happened to be getting married in Vietnam at the
              same time I was conjuring up how I was going to go about what I
              wanted to do. I took the opportunity with the two weeks I had
              earlier in the year to observe and capture everything I possibly
              could that could fuel my inspiration while in Vietnam: textures,
              building structures, street signs, the flowers and plants;
              anything I could lay my eyes on, I wanted to capture. With all of
              this, I took all of my observations and began a rebrand campaign
              for my mom’s small business nail salon by bringing Vietnamese
              elements and aesthetics into modern brand design including a new
              logo, business cards, service menus, and a revival of a vintage
              form of advertisement in a paper fan. I am bringing these
              Vietnamese elements to my home in the United States by means of
              the design branding, and I am simultaneously bringing bits and
              pieces of my mom’s home here into the salon. This project exists a
              “thank you” to her.

              <i>The Art of Climate Education</i> aims to use art as a catalyst
              for change. This book is a collection of primarily installation
              based artworks that seek to educate viewers on climate issues and
              inspire them to take action. Each piece of art was selected based
              on its ability to convey an important message about the need to
              conserve our environment. Some works use appreciation as the
              motivating factor, while others propose solutions to how we might
              tangibly make a difference in protecting our world. The goal is to
              invite curiosity and inspire viewers to learn in a new way. During
              my time in GDES, I discovered my passion for designing
              informational publications for climate education. This project is
              a culmination of my love for art, research, bookbinding, and the
              desire to make a small impact on the world by inspiring someone to
              make a positive change in their lifestyle to help protect our
              Earth.

              <i>Doodle Anthology</i> sets out to compile and remaster doodles I
              created on schoolwork throughout my education from kindergarten to
              senior year of high school. The anthology aims to provide insight
              into the evolution of my artistic style, creative expression, and
              interests over the years with additional information about their
              subject matter, context and their significance to me. Old
              schoolwork is not a resource many people utilize or still have
              access to. Many of the homework sheets that the images were
              sourced from were found loose and faded in a dusty box under my
              bed. The doodles have been scanned, isolated, and retraced in a
              digital format, providing clarity to long forgotten scribbles on
              crumpled sheets of paper. Doodling as a practice is often
              associated with procrastination, so I wanted to explore the idea
              of creating artwork out of a product that came from a desire not
              to work. I set out to create a repository for an art form that is
              normally discarded and explore the biases that affect what kinds
              of art we decide to preserve.

              <i>slowing… slowing… slowing…</i> slowing is the hand; slowing is

              be looked at as a machine, minimizing individual impact and sense
