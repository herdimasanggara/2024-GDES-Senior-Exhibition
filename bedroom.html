            <i>Masking Reality</i> presents a series of multimedia masks that examine the role of surrealism in identity
            and liberation. Each element in the work serves a distinct purpose: the delicate intricacies of yarn and
            embroidery symbolize the interconnectedness of the human experience, while the malleable nature of clay and
            wire represents the fluidity of self. Together, these elements draw from my own experiences navigating the
            complexities and inner turmoil inherent in my journey toward self-discovery.

            <i>Penny and the Land of Grief</i> is a children’s book that describes the five stages of grief as cities
            that you travel through. Grief is not a linear process, regardless of what we like to believe. You can spend
            a long time in anger, or bounce between depression and denial. But regardless of what “city” you’re in, the
            end of that journey is always going to be acceptance. I wanted to be able to provide both children and
            adults with the language that we sometimes find ourselves lacking when are going through hard times, such as
            the death of a family member, the loss of our home, or the end of a friendship.

            <i>FOREVER CANVAS.</i> I don't want to use clothes as a canvas to create a brand but as a way to immortalize
            pieces of my
            past work that are important to me. In doing so, I am making a Forever Canvas. Over the past four years,
            most of my work has been posters, which I feel have a defined life span. Usually, posters wind up forgotten
            once the advertising period or project is over, indicating the end of the posters' lifetime. By using
            clothing as a medium for design, I can create things that are more meaningful to me and will have a more
            extended life than any poster could.

            <i>The Reminiscence Collection</i> website is a comprehensive archive that catalogs over 170 video games,
            each thoughtfully detailed with information about their developers, publishers, series, platforms, and more.
            This concept was influenced by a poster and book design I created in Fall 2021, featuring cover images and
            thorough descriptions. The website elevates user experience by offering features like cover image downloads
            and zooming capabilities. Additionally, search and sorting tools are easily accessible, found in both the
            top navigation bar and the consistently positioned game icon sidebar, situated on the left side of each page
            and revealed upon clicking. It also offers accessibility options including a light/dark mode switch,
            adjustable font sizes, and text-to-speech functionality. Registered members can engage with the content by
            liking, commenting, and rating games, while a user-friendly dashboard conveniently tracks these interactions
            for easy historical access. This platform is a demonstration to my passion for graphic design and my
            enthusiasm for video gaming, offering a space where others can also appreciate and interact with their
            beloved games. <a

            <i>First Last Words.</i> First Last Words is a death writing prompt book. Writing about death is one way to
            face anxieties about it.
            My main goal in making this book was to help people facing fears of death, leading them to start talking
            about it more.

            It covers almost all topics related to death, including death rituals, bucket lists, writing to loved ones
            who have passed, final words, final meals, and the afterlife, just to name a few. Everyone’s experience with
            death differs, which is heavily considered. Anyone and everyone can complete the prompts; they are left
            vague on purpose.

            Most prompts are journal-style, but there are a few creative writing, drawing, and collaging prompts
            throughout the book. The prompts are divided into segments: life, grief, dying, dead, and afterlife. Between
            each segment is a transition page that includes definitions you may need.

            <i>Harmony Unveiled.</i> Music has been a big part of me since I was young, and I’ve had all these thoughts
            about what music means to people and how it affects them. This project aims to explore the proven impacts of
            music on humanity/society.
            I explored four topics to connect music and humanity: humanness, psychology, place, and art.
            For my research, I interviewed a handful of close friends about their
            experiences with music, with questions loosely revolving around each topic. Each topic (mentioned above) had
            three questions each in order to gain a wide variety of answers. The interview was in person and recorded in
            a casual setting. All interviews were edited and compiled into one large video interspersed with recordings
            of concerts (both mine and others) for added musicality.
            I compiled more formal internet research and created 4 booklets broaching each topic in a dynamic and
            colorful way using typography and image gradients. These booklets are each placed inside a CD case with a
            DVD that contains each corresponding video section. The videos were available to play on a portable DVD
            player at the Open House exhibition, and the full video is available to watch on Youtube starting May 2nd,
            2024.

            twenties right now, I wish I had a guide or multiple guides to assist me even before entering my twenties. I

            <i>Raw Material</i> is an archival diary that serves as a testament to the importance of note taking and the
            preservation of process work. The book is a collection of notes, sketches, and other materials that inspire
            my design practice. In essence, it's an exploration into archiving and preserving concepts. Over the last
            few years, I've gathered bits and pieces of my life, insights gained, and thoughts pondered. These
            fragments, though seemingly scattered, form the essence of my growth and exploration during this

            <i>Intricate Nothings.s</i>Mosaics and traditional Arabic embroidery have many similarities, both meticulous
            labors of love. Each
            stitch a tile; a piece of a larger whole. A single tessera or a cross-stitch on its own is beautiful in its
            simplicity, but add one more, then another, and another, and soon a narrative is born. But the effort behind
            these individually laid tiles/made stitches often go unnoticed in the places they live and the purposes they
            serve. Thus, I combined these two art forms by creating an embroidered mosaic of decorative ornamental
            patterns and designs. Whether the time and work put into this piece will go unnoticed remains to be seen.

            My synthesis project focuses on the complexities of daughterhood and mother/daughter relationships. The

            way to generate a personalized list of resource and media recommendations based on the user’s specific need
            within this broader topic. This project is also about finding community within the complexities of these
            relationships. Using a handful of public engagement prompts I have also been gathering anonymous survey
            responses, voicemails, and text messages to help me understand where communication struggles exist within
            the context of mother/daughter or parent/child relationships. The user is also able to browse through a
