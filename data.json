Registered members can engage with the content by liking, commenting, and rating games, while a user-friendly dashboard conveniently tracks these interactions for easy historical access.

However, I believe this concept can be adapted and applied to platonic relationships as well. There is very little material on this topic, so l decided to develop my own concepts by learning from other friendship experiences.\n\nFrom my research, I felt people were missing out on a very key component to understanding the deep meaning of friendship as a whole due to the lack of platonic language representation. My project allows access to an approachable package that welcomes them regardless of their knowledge of the concept of different friendship dynamics.\n\nAs a final component, I developed a quiz for people take to discover what their platonic language is before they view the items within the box. When viewing my piece, there are 5 different ways, depending on your preference to learn about each language.",

Some of the visual identity taken from personal sense of connection to water based fauna fostered by aquatic environments, feeling a sense of relatability due to these creatures also  engaging with the world perceptually different than other people do at least tactilely. The outcome of all these explorations is a sensory box that you can enter and experience multiple tactile senses on the inside and outside of it. The goal is for the participants and observers to be able to interact with the piece, hopefully engaging in their own unique experience with the piece. The intention is to provide a closed space where the participant can have a moment of stillness, if they desire they can touch and interact with the structure, or they can just enjoy the visual experience.",

Each topic (mentioned above) had three questions each in order to gain a wide variety of answers. The interview was in person and recorded in a casual setting. All interviews were edited and compiled into one large video interspersed with recordings of concerts (both mine and others) for added musicality. \nI compiled more formal internet research and created 4 booklets broaching each topic in a dynamic and colorful way using typography and image gradients. These booklets are each placed inside a CD case with a DVD that contains each corresponding video section.

    "Project Description": "“We shape ourselves to fit this world and we also shape the\nworld.” The inspiration for my project comes from my craft\nexperience with hammering metalwork. As a senior student\nin college, I want to record this time that we are facing the\nchanges or options after graduating. At this time, how do we\nshape ourselves to fit this new situation and what could we do\nin/for this society in the future? I see the real world as a new\nlearning environment, much like a child’s perspective. Viewing\nmyself as a child, I anticipate facing unknown challenges\nahead. Similar to how kids learn through the alphabet, I\npropose an “alphabet book” as a symbolic tool for the young\ngeneration to understand and navigate the complexities of real\nsociety.",

    "Project Description": "My synthesis project focuses on the complexities of daughterhood and mother/daughter relationships. The MotherBoard Archive is a curated library of resources and media centered around navigating complex mother/daughter relationships, girlhood, self healing, and healing relational patterns. The digital archive functions as a gentle guide; a recipe for healing and self reflection. The MotherBoard archive can be engaged with purely as a resource library, or (by means of an interactive personality quiz function) as a way to generate a personalized list of resource and media recommendations based on the user’s specific need within this broader topic. This project is also about finding community within the complexities of these relationships. Using a handful of public engagement prompts I have also been gathering anonymous survey responses, voicemails, and text messages to help me understand where communication struggles exist within the context of mother/daughter or parent/child relationships. The user is also able to browse through a growing selection of these anonymous voicemail and text submissions.",

    "Project Description": "*The Art of Climate Education* aims to use art as a catalyst for change. This book is a collection of primarily installation based artworks that seek to educate viewers on climate issues and inspire them to take action. Each piece of art was selected based on its ability to convey an important message about the need to conserve our environment. Some works use appreciation as the motivating factor, while others propose solutions to how we might tangibly make a difference in protecting our world. The goal is to invite curiosity and inspire viewers to learn in a new way. During my time in GDES, I discovered my passion for designing informational publications for climate education. This project is a culmination of my love for art, research, bookbinding, and the desire to make a small impact on the world by inspiring someone to make a positive change in their lifestyle to help protect our Earth.",

    "Project Description": "This project creates a 2024 calendar focused on the Chinese 24 Solar Terms. Each page represents a specific solar term, showcasing associated traditional foods and cultural significance through uniquely designed icons and color schemes. This calendar is not only a record of time but also a modern interpretation and visual presentation of traditional Chinese solar term culture. Printed in color, each icon is rich in detail and vibrant in hues, designed to engage users in exploring the culinary customs and cultural depth behind each solar term. The calendar serves both practical daily use and as an educational and cultural dissemination tool, enhancing understanding and interest in traditional solar term knowledge.",
