              <i>Cuentos de Oro.</i> I'm immersing myself in the rich tapestry of my family's history by creating a newsletter based on my El Salvadorian and
              Ecuadorian heritage. My journey with The Commonwealth Times has been instrumental in igniting my passion for newspaper
              layout design.
              
              Ecuador in particular has a legacy of indigenous civilizations like the Incas and the Quitu-Cara people, who crafted
              gold artifacts long before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors.
              
              I use the concept of 'oro' (gold), as a metaphor to represent the invaluable wealth of familial stories and traditions
              that have been passed down through generations. In addition to writing and designing articles, I plan to create a new
              family tree to serve as a reference tool for future generations. Therefore, demonstrating the longevity of the project
              that goes beyond the university wall.

              <i>A Playful Learning Journey.</i> The goal of creating a playful and engaging tool for learning the Tibetan alphabet is to make the process of language collection enjoyable and interactive, particularly for children. Traditional language learning methods can sometimes be percieved as boring, leading to disinterest and reduced engagement, especially among younger learners. By infusing playfulness into the learning experience, I am capturing the attention of Tibetan-American children and fostering a positive attitude towards language acquisition.

              <i>TWOTHOUSAND RECORDS</i> is a speculative record label that revolves around the idea that music should be enjoyed, not
              made for a profit. The label has non-exclusively signed eight different artists of different sounds and genres, with no
              contracts or expectations, so our artists can create and inspire to their heart's content. TWOTHOUSAND RECORDS has also
              teamed up with the Working Artist Union to ensure that all rights to work created for our record label stay with the
              artist as well as revenues earned, leaving no room for any unfair treatment.

              I have a great love for album art and creating work that interacts with music. Over the past few months, I collaborated
              with musicians of different genres to create three album artworks to build my portfolio. <i>Ride or Die or Both</i> is
              an album by Son of Soong, an artist heavily inspired by Star Trek and astronomy. For the album art, I created an
              illustration of Data's face and the hand of Noonian Soong to reference the artist's name directly (Data is an android
              created by Soong). <i>Moire</i> by Malaphor is an album currently in the making. It is an experimental album mixing
              different genres and sounds in a style reminiscent of Amon Tobin, Aphex Twin, Drumcorps, and Igorrr, among others. For
              the album art, I created a digital moire pattern with overlapping circles and vertical and horizontal lines with colors
              that relate to the musician's aesthetic. <i>Dungeonscapes Vol. 2</i> by SNGN is part of an ongoing series of ambient
              albums meant for tabletop RPGs. I had created the album art for Dungeonscapes Vol. 1 back in 2020. For Dungeonscapes
              Vol. 2, I continued with a traditional painting to maintain the same aesthetic.

              <i>Transitional Release</i> is the name of an exhibition showcasing paintings by Amina Coleman-Davis. Working as a
              curator and designer of this exhibition, I came up with the entire identity for the exhibition. The bright and exciting
              colors present in the designs are a direct reflection of the colors used in her paintings. Amina uses her practice as a
              way to grieve and remember her ancestors, claiming that death is a “transitional release” and something that should be
              celebrated. The collection of paintings present in the exhibition is called “Scribbled with Love,” thus the
              scribbledness of the identity. I was intrigued by her bush strokes and the flow of her work, picking out specific
              strokes that stood out specifically for the identity. As well as designing the main logo and design of the exhibition, I
              have also created several other designs that would be present at the opening, such as tickets and postcards.Creating
              this exhibition identity has given me the opportunity to view death in a new way while also learning how to properly
              exhibit someone else's work in a way that does it justice.

              <I>Chats of Rose Hill & Summer Street.</I> This is a piece for me & pieces of me, that I share with you:
              
              A collection of stories and objects that have belonged to past relatives of mine; I mostly follow female lines on both
              maternal and paternal sides. All four of my grandparents have passed, but I did know them. My grandmothers have always
              held my heart warmly, and although they are gone, that warmth has never left.
              
              My Mom is an only girl with two brothers, and my Dad has three brothers and one sister, my only aunt. I don't have any
              sisters either. The three of us have been put in charge of keeping these belongings and stories safe. Now, I take the
              opportunity to showcase these well-preserved pieces and give some backstory to my lengthy and dense inheritances. This
              is only chipping the surface of what I have.
              
              To me, these are rich in personal value and memory. Also... yes...they are cool to look at.

              <i>Platonic Love Languages.</i> My project is based on the theory of love languages, reinterpreting the concept and making it into my own to
              redistribute to others.
              
              The concept of love languages for romantic relationships already exists. However, I believe this concept can be adapted
              and applied to platonic relationships as well. There is very little material on this topic, so l decided to develop my
              own concepts by learning from other friendship experiences.
              
              From my research, I felt people were missing out on a very key component to understanding the deep meaning of friendship
              as a whole due to the lack of platonic language representation. My project allows access to an approachable package that
              welcomes them regardless of their knowledge of the concept of different friendship dynamics.
              
              As a final component, I developed a quiz for people take to discover what their platonic language is before they view
              the items within the box. When viewing my piece, there are 5 different ways, depending on your preference to learn about
              each language.

              <i>The Guestbook. </i>From November 2023 to April 2024, I gathered my friends in my apartment in Richmond Virginia to hold a dinner party
              every two weeks. This original group was asked to make invitations and bring in new guests with an interest in craft. As
              the event grew, it changed, and each dinner became a new iteration in the series. Dinners centered community,
              performance, food, making, and the possibilities that opened up to us when we were all gathered in one place. I want to
              hold so much space for the people I care about to be joyful and queer and I hope to show others how expansive their
              communities can be.
